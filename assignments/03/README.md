# CSCD27 Assignment 3

So, You Want to be a hacker? This is your chance. In this assignment you will have the chance to write your own exploits, penetrate a server and hack a web application:

- Part 1. Vulnerability exploitation (Lab 9)
- Part 2. Penetration Testing (Lab 6 & 10)
- Part 3. Web Security (Lab 11)

Like assignment 1 and 2, assignment 3 is worth 100 points however there are up to 300 points to grab here! This assignment has been designed to offer 100 points by applying course materials. However, getting extra points will require you to go beyond that.

Therefore, I recommend to attempt the bonus questions once you believe you have secured a good grade.

Good Luck!

### Academic Integrity

Most of the exercises proposed here are about understanding a vulnerability and writing an exploit.

- you are **allowed** to discuss the vulnerability with someone else in details
- you are **not allowed** to discuss how to write the exploit
- you are **not allowed** to share your exploit

___

## Part 1. Vulnerability exploitation

These challenges should be compiled within the following vagrant VM:
```shell
cd ~/cscd27f16_space/CSCD27-F16/assignments/03/code/part1
$ vagrant up
$ vagrant ssh
ubuntu-trusty64$ cd /vagrant
```

All of the challenges below should work with `python2`.

### Challenge 1 [10 points]: Overwriting a return-address with a buffer-overflow

Challenge #1 reads an input from the command line and prints a message. Your attack will provide an input value that causes the program to execute a backdoor that is already in the program.

- Compile: `gcc challenge1.c -o challenge1 -fno-stack-protector -m32`
- Attack: `./challenge1 $(python attack1.py)`
- Reading: [Lab 09: Attack 1](https://github.com/ThierrySans/CSCD27-F16/tree/master/labs/09)

### Challenge 2 [10 points]: Routing control to shellcode

Challenge #2 reads from stdin and prints a message. Your attack will provide an input value that causes the program to execute a backdoor that is **not** already in the program.

- Compile: `gcc challenge2.c -o challenge2 -fno-stack-protector -m32 -z execstack`
- Attack: `./challenge2 $(python attack2.py)`
- Reading: [Lab 09: Attack 2](https://github.com/ThierrySans/CSCD27-F16/tree/master/labs/09)

### Challenge 3 [15 points]: Indirect control-transfer to shellcode

This challenge code uses "safe" string-copy function strncpy(), so you won't be able to use the same approach as for challenge #1 and #2. Instead, you'll have to find a more devious way to create a backdoor.

- Compile: `gcc challenge3.c -o challenge3 -fno-stack-protector -m32 -z execstack`
- Attack: `./challenge3 $(python attack3.py)`
- Reading: [Adjacent Memory Overflows](https://www.exploit-db.com/papers/13148/)

### Challenge 4 [15 points]: File-based shellcode

The command-line argument to challenge #4 names a file to be read. This file is a list of short words (less than 12 characters). Your attack will create a file that causes the program to create a backdoor.

- Compile: `gcc challenge4.c -o challenge4 -fno-stack-protector -m32 -z execstack`
- Attack: `./challenge4 <(python attack4.py)`

### Challenge 5 [20 bonus points]: Shellcode in a no-execute stack environment

An important defense against buffer overflows is use of a hardware/OS feature that flags the stack address space as non-executable. The processor will not execute any instructions that are stored on the stack. You can still use buffer-overflow tactics, such as overflowing variable storage space and modifying a return address, but you'll have to find a new mechanism for creating a backdoor.

- Compile: `gcc challenge5.c -o challenge5 -m32`
- Attack: `./challenge5 $(python attack5.py)`
- Reading: [Stack Smashing On A Modern Linux System](https://www.exploit-db.com/papers/24085/)

### Challenge 6 [20 bonus points]: Shellcode in randomized-addressing stack environment

In all the previous challenges, stack addresses were consistent across executions, so that every time a vulnerable function was called the stack layout would be the same. In real systems, this is usually not the case, due to the address-space-layout randomization defense, which changes the layout of program address-space, including the stack, on every execution. Challenge #6 is similar to earlier challenge #2, except that the stack position is randomly shifted by 0-255 bytes for each execution. Your challenge is to construct an string that challenge #6 will read from the command line,	which obtains a root shell in spite of ASLR.

- Enable ASRL: `sudo bash -c `echo 2 | sudo tee /proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space`
- Compile: `gcc challenge6.c -o challenge6 -m32`
- Attack: `./challenge6 $(python attack6.py)`
- Reading: [Stack Smashing On A Modern Linux System](https://www.exploit-db.com/papers/24085/)

### Challenge 7 [30 bonus points]: Bypassing authentication

Challenge #7 reads an input from the command line and asks the user for a password. If the password is correct, the program will execute the command given at the command line. Rather than trying to crack the password (it is a strong password), use your hacking skills to bypass the authentication and execute any arbitrary command.

- Compile: `gcc challenge7.c -o challenge7 -m32 -fno-stack-protector -lcrypt`
- Attack: `python attack7.py | ./challenge7 bash`

### Challenge 8 [30 bonus points]: Remote code execution via a reverse shell

Challenge #8 is a network service that reads messages from a socket and sends a message back. Assuming that you do not have access to the machine where this programs run, use your hacking skills to install a backdoor (on port 55555) on that remote server.

- Compile: `gcc challenge8.c -o challenge8 -m32 -fno-stack-protector -z execstack`
- Run: `./challenge8 11111`
- Attack: `python attack7.py`

## Part 2. Penetration Testing

Unfortunately, this vagrant setup for this part does not work on the linux lab. To do this exercise, you will need to install Virtualbox and Vagrant on your personal laptop.

```shell
cd ~/cscd27f16_space/CSCD27-F16/assignments/03/code/part2
$ vagrant up
```

The vagrant setup is composed of two boxes:

- **kali** is the attacker's machine (ip 10.0.1.102)
- **target** is the victim's machine (ip 10.0.1.101)

In the challenges below, you should use exclusively the kali VM without ssh'ing into the target VM.

## Challenge 9 [10 bonus points]: Nmap - Network Mapping and Host Fingerprinting

In this challenge, we are going to use nmap to discover the services running on the target machine. This command exports the results in a file called `target.nmap`:

```shell
$ nmap -O —sV -p0-65535 10.0.1.101 -oN target.nmap
```

## Challenge 10 [20 bonus points]: OpenVAS - Vulnerability Scanner

In this challenge, we are going to use OpenVAS vulnerability scanner to audit the security of the target:

```shell
$ openvas-setup
$ openvas-start
Starting OpenVas Services
Starting Greenbone Security Assistant: gsad.
Starting OpenVAS Scanner: openvassd.
Starting OpenVAS Manager: openvasmd.
```

**Important:** Make sure that the 4 OpenVAS components have all started correctly without any `ERROR`. If any, stop OpenVAS (`openvas-stop`) and restart it.

Once OpenVAS has correctly started, add the admin user:

```shell
$ openvasmd —create-user=admin
$ openvasmd —new-password=admin —user=admin
```

Finally, scan the target and export (as a pdf) the report through the OpenVAS web interface (https://localhost:9392)[https://localhost:9392]

## Challenge 11 [20 bonus points]: Metasploit - Exploit Framework

In this challenge, we are going to use Metasploit to exploit a vulnerability ([CVE-2012-1823](http://www.cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2012-1823/)) in the CGI module of PHP (versions before 5.3.12 and before 5.4.2). First, let us update and start the metasploit console:

```shell
$ msfupdate
$ service postgresql start
$ msfconsole
```

Thus, we can load, configure and run the exploit:

1. load the `­use exploit/multi/http/php_cgi_arg_injection` exploit

    ```shell
    msf > use exploit/multi/http/php_cgi_arg_injection
    ```

2. show and assign values to the exploit arguments:

    ```shell
    msf > show options
    msf > set TARGET 10.0.1.101
    ```

3. run the exploit

    ```
    msf > exploit
    ```

___

## Part 3. Web Security

These challenges requires a web application hosted on a vagrant box:
```shell
cd ~/cscd27f16_space/CSCD27-F16/assignments/03/code/part3
$ vagrant up
```

You should **not** ssh into the vagrant. Instead, all interactions can be done through the web browser by visiting [here](http://localhost:8080/).

While using and attacking this web application, you may want to reset it. No need to reset the vagrant, you can just reset the web application by visiting [the reset page](http://localhost:8080/reset.php).

All of the challenges below should work with `python3` and use exclusively mallory's credentials:

```
login: mallory@example.com
password: pass4mallory
```

However, some challenges (#13, #14 and #18) requires alice to login and browse the main page once the attack has been setup. You can check that by signing in manually with Alice's credentials:

```
login: alice@example.com
password: pass4alice!
```

### Challenge 12 [10 points]: Incomplete mediation

The application was built in such a way that only authenticated users can delete their own messages. From the frontend, it seems correctly implemented as authenticated users can click on a delete button for their own messages only. However, it might not be correctly implemented in the backend. As Mallory, find an easy way to delete Alice's message that says "Mallory should not be trusted!".

- Attack: `python attack12.py`

This attack does not require Alice to do anything.

### Challenge 13 [10 points]: Content spoofing with CSRF attack

The application seems to  be vulnerable to a cross-site request forgery attack. As Mallory, find and exploit this vulnerability to make Alice post a message that says "Mallory is a trustworthy person!".

- Attack: `python attack13.py`

Most likely, your CSRF attack will inject a URL code on the webpage. For the attack to work, we assume that Alice signs in and visits the main page after your attack was executed. Th attack should not disrupt the normal behavior of the application. Alice might notice that some image links are broken but nothing else.

### Challenge 14 [15 points]: Stealing authentication token with XSS attack

The application seems to be vulnerable to a cross-site scripting attack. As Mallory, find and exploit this vulnerability to steal Alice's authentication token and send it to the Mallory's website at (replace `__alice_id_` with alice's authentication token and `__your_utorid__` with your utorid):

```
https://mathlab.utsc.utoronto.ca/courses/cscd27f16/assignment/03/server/token.php?utorid=__your_utorid__&PHPSESSID=__alice_session_id___
```

To verify that Mallory's website has receive the token, you can visit

```
https://mathlab.utsc.utoronto.ca/courses/cscd27f16/assignment/03/server/?utorid=__your_utorid__

```

- Attack: `python attack14.py`

Most likely, your XSS attack will inject a malicious javascript code on the webpage. For the attack to work, we assume that Alice signs in and visits the main page after your attack was executed. The attack should not disrupt the normal behavior of the application. Alice should not notice anything.

### Challenge 15 [15 points]: Bypassing authentication with SQLi attack

The application seems to be vulnerable to an SQL injection attack. As Mallory, find and exploit this vulnerability to login as Alice and post message as Alice that says "Got You!". This attack does not require Alice to do anything.

- Attack: `python attack15.py`

This attack does not require Alice to do anything.

### Challenge 16 [15 bonus points]: Stealing login/password with XSS attack

By exploiting the same cross-site scripting attack as in challenge #14, find a way to steal Alice's password instead of the authentication token.

- Attack: `python attack16.py`

Most likely, your XSS attack will inject a malicious javascript code on the webpage. For the attack to work, we assume that Alice visits the main page after your attack was executed. The attack might disrupt the normal behavior of the application.

### Challenge 17 [15 bonus points]: Remote Code Execution with file inclusion Attack

The application seems to be vulnerable to a file inclusion attack. As Mallory, find and exploit this vulnerability to install a reverse shell on the server. You should write your own reverse shell code rather than using a fancy one that you might found on the web. The reverse shell should be included in your `attack17.py` code.

- Attack: `python attack17.py`

This attack does not require Alice to do anything.

### Challenge 18 [20 bonus points]: Remote Code Execution with SQLi attack

By exploiting the same SQL injection attack as in challenge #13, find a way to install a reverse shell on the server. ou should write your own reverse shell code rather than using a fancy one that you might found on the web. The reverse shell should be included in your `attack17.py` code.

- Attack: `python attack18.py`

This attack does not require Alice to do anything.
